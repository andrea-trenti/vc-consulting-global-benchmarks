# Management Consulting Markets in the G7 and Switzerland:
## Size, GDP Ratios and Firm Structure 

---

## Abstract

This paper benchmarks the **management consulting industry** across the G7 economies and Switzerland. Using recent market-size estimates, it constructs:

- consulting **revenue levels** (in local currency and USD);
- **consulting/GDP ratios**;
- **headcount and firm-structure indicators** (number of firms, share of small practices).

The main findings are:

- consulting markets in **Germany, the UK and the US** are extremely large in absolute terms, supporting dense ecosystems of large firms and boutiques;
- **Spain and Italy** have smaller markets but high consulting/GDP ratios once outsourcing and IT services are included;
- **Switzerland** hosts a disproportionately large consulting industry relative to its population, with a mix of global firms and specialised boutiques.

## 1. Introduction

Management consulting plays a dual role:

1. as a **demand driver** and client base for B2B technology and analytics startups;
2. as a **transmission channel** through which innovations diffuse across corporate clients.

Understanding the size and structure of consulting markets is therefore a natural complement to VC benchmarking. This paper compares consulting across the G7 and Switzerland, focusing on orders of magnitude and relative positions.

## 2. Data and methods

The analysis combines:

- industry research (e.g. IBISWorld, Mordor Intelligence, Feaco surveys);
- national consulting associations (e.g. BDU in Germany, FEACO members for other European countries);
- macroeconomic data (GDP) from official sources.

Due to definitional differences (pure management consulting vs consulting + IT + outsourcing), figures are reported as **ranges** and **approximations**. Where multiple sources exist, we use mid-point values.

## 3. Market size by country

### 3.1 Revenue levels

**Table 1 – Management consulting market size (latest available, orders of magnitude)**

| Country        | Market size (bn, local currency) | Year (approx.) | Perimeter (management vs broader) |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| United States  | ~60 bn USD (narrow) / >300 bn USD (broad advisory incl. IT) | 2023–2024 | Large spread reflects inclusion of IT and tax advisory. |
| Canada         | ~8–10 bn CAD                     | 2023           | Management + IT consulting. |
| United Kingdom | ~30–40 bn GBP / USD equivalent   | 2023–2024      | Includes strategy, operations, IT. |
| Germany        | ~44 bn EUR                       | 2023–2024      | Management + IT consulting; >220k employees, ~19k firms. |
| France         | ~12–17 bn EUR                    | 2023–2024      | Strong presence of global firms and mid-size specialists. |
| Italy          | ~7–8 bn EUR                      | 2022–2025      | Rapid growth driven by digitalisation and PNRR-related projects. |
| Spain          | ~22 bn EUR (consulting + IT + outsourcing) | 2024 | Very broad perimeter including BPO. |
| Japan          | ~7–8 bn USD                      | 2023–2024      | Conservative estimates, significant corporate in-house consulting. |
| Switzerland    | ~3.6–4.0 bn USD                  | 2024–2025      | Mature market with high fee levels and niche firms. |

Absolute levels vary widely, with the US and Germany/UK being clear leaders in their respective regions.

## 4. Consulting/GDP ratios

To compare across economies, we scale consulting revenue by GDP. Given the perimeter issues, these ratios are indicative but informative.

**Table 2 – Consulting as % of GDP (approximate)**

| Country        | GDP (bn, same currency) | Consulting revenue (bn) | Consulting/GDP (%) |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| United States  | ~29,200 USD             | 60–300 USD              | ~0.2–1.0           |
| Canada         | ~2,300 CAD              | 8–10 CAD                | ~0.3–0.4           |
| United Kingdom | ~3,000–3,200 GBP        | 30–40 GBP               | ~1.0–1.3           |
| Germany        | ~4,300 EUR              | 44 EUR                  | ~1.0               |
| France         | ~3,000 EUR              | 12–17 EUR               | ~0.4–0.6           |
| Italy          | ~2,200–2,300 EUR        | 7–8 EUR                 | ~0.3–0.35          |
| Spain          | ~1,600 EUR              | 22 EUR                  | ~1.3–1.4           |
| Japan          | ~550 tn JPY             | ~1 tn JPY equivalent    | ~0.2               |
| Switzerland    | ~0.95 tn USD equiv.     | 3.6–4.0 USD             | ~0.4               |

Key takeaways:

- **Germany and the UK** are at or above **1% of GDP** once IT consulting is fully included.
- **Spain** appears surprisingly high, but this reflects the inclusion of **outsourcing and BPO** alongside consulting.
- **Italy** has a smaller market relative to GDP, but one that is **rapidly expanding**.
- **Switzerland** combines a high per-capita consulting base with lower GDP share than Germany/UK, reflecting its strong industrial and financial sectors.

## 5. Firm structure and headcount

Where data permit, we can approximate the **firm size distribution**.

- **Germany:** about **19,000 consulting firms**, employing **~220,000 people**; around **87%** of firms have revenue **below 1 million EUR**, indicating a long tail of boutiques and small practices.
- **Switzerland:** around **3,600 firms** in management consulting, with an estimated **3–4% annual increase** in firm count over the last five years; market dominated by a combination of global firms, large Swiss champions and specialised boutiques.
- **Spain:** roughly **285,000 professionals** across consulting, IT services and outsourcing; a few large players plus many SMEs.
- **Italy:** several thousands of consulting firms, with rapid growth of small and mid-size entities due to digitalisation projects and EU funds.

These structures matter for startups:

- a **long tail of small boutiques** increases the potential customer base for tools and analytics sold on a **per-seat** or **per-project** basis;
- highly concentrated markets with a few mega-firms may be harder to penetrate but easier to scale once a vendor is approved.

## 6. Growth dynamics

Recent years show:

- **double-digit growth** in European consulting revenue in 2022 (post-pandemic catch-up), moderating to high single digits in 2023–2024;
- strong demand for:
  - digital transformation and data/AI projects,
  - ESG and sustainability work,
  - regulatory and risk management advisory.

Switzerland follows this pattern with:

- consulting market growth of **~4–7% per year** over 2020–2025;
- particularly strong demand in **financial services, pharmaceuticals and advanced manufacturing**.

## 7. Implications for VC-backed startups

The size and structure of consulting markets have direct implications for B2B startups:

- Countries with **large and fragmented consulting sectors** (Germany, UK, Spain, Switzerland) provide:
  - many potential customers,
  - multiple route-to-market partners (consulting firms embedding startup products into their projects).
- Markets with **smaller consulting sectors relative to GDP** (Italy, Japan) may still be attractive, but require:
  - more direct enterprise sales,
  - closer alignment with government programs and corporate innovation units.

---

## Caveat

- Market-size estimates differ substantially across sources due to perimeter choices (e.g., inclusion of IT, outsourcing, audit), so figures should be interpreted as **ranges**.
- Data on headcount and firm counts are often based on surveys and may under-represent micro-firms.
- Consulting/GDP ratios are sensitive to FX assumptions and timing mismatch between GDP and revenue data.
