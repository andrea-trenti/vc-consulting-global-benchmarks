# Millionaires, Wealth Distribution and Private Capital:
## United States, China, Europe and Switzerland

---

## Abstract

This paper investigates the **wealth backbone** behind venture capital and consulting markets, focusing on:

- the **number of millionaires (HNWI)** by country and region;
- the share of global millionaires residing in each major economy;
- the implications for the depth of **private-capital markets** (VC, PE, family offices).

Using global wealth reports and complementary data, it shows that:

- the **United States** hosts nearly **40% of the world’s millionaires**, far above its population share;
- **China** has the second-largest absolute number of millionaires but a much lower **HNWI per capita**;
- **Europe** as a whole hosts around **one quarter** of global millionaires, with strong concentrations in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland;
- **Switzerland** stands out as a **global outlier** in millionaires per capita and in the ratio of private wealth to population.

## 1. Data sources

The analysis is based on:

- global wealth reports (e.g. UBS / former Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report);
- regional and country tables listing the **number of adults with net worth ≥ USD 1 million**;
- national statistics on population.

Year-to-year variations are limited; for our purposes, we focus on **orders of magnitude**.

## 2. Global distribution of millionaires

At the global level:

- total number of adults with net worth ≥1 million USD is around **60–65 million**;
- this corresponds to roughly **1–1.5%** of the adult population worldwide.

By region:

- **North America** (essentially the US and Canada) hosts **~40–42%** of global millionaires;
- **Europe** hosts **~25–27%**;
- **Asia-Pacific (excluding China and India)** hosts **~17%**;
- **China** alone accounts for **~10%** of the world’s millionaires.

## 3. Country-level millionaire counts

Table 1 provides approximate counts for key economies.

**Table 1 – Estimated number of millionaires (net worth ≥1 mn USD)**

| Country/Region | Millionaires (thousands) | Share of world total | Millionaires as % of adults (approx.) |
|----------------|-------------------------:|---------------------:|--------------------------------------:|
| United States  | ~24,000                  | ~38–40%              | ~7–9%                                 |
| China          | ~6,000                   | ~9–10%               | ~0.4–0.6%                             |
| Japan          | >3,000                   | ~5%                  | ~3–4%                                 |
| France         | >2,000                   | ~3%                  | ~4–5%                                 |
| United Kingdom | >2,000                   | ~3%                  | ~5–6%                                 |
| Germany        | >2,000                   | ~3%                  | ~3–4%                                 |
| Italy          | ~1,000–1,500             | ~2%                  | ~2–3%                                 |
| Spain          | ~1,000                   | ~1–2%                | ~2–3%                                 |
| Switzerland    | ~1,000                   | ~1–2%                | well above 10%                        |

The exact ranking fluctuates with exchange rates and asset prices, but the **order of magnitude** is robust.

## 4. Millionaires per capita and private capital depth

The number of millionaires per capita provides a proxy for the potential domestic base of:

- LPs (limited partners) in VC and PE funds;
- angel investors;
- family offices and wealth-management clients.

### 4.1 United States

- Around **24 million** millionaires out of **~260–280 million adults** → about **8–9%** of adults.
- The US also hosts **hundreds of billionaires**, further increasing the capital available for private investments.

Implications:

- deep domestic LP base for VC/PE;
- vibrant angel-investing scene;
- highly developed wealth-management and advisory industry.

### 4.2 China

- **~6 million** millionaires out of **more than 1 billion adults** → around **0.5%** of adults.
- Despite the large absolute number, per-capita density is much lower than in the US or Europe.

Implications:

- high concentration of investible private wealth in a relatively small elite;
- significant role for **state-linked** capital and large financial institutions in VC and PE;
- more fragile base for broad angel activity.

### 4.3 Europe and Switzerland

- Europe as a region hosts **~16–17 million** millionaires, about **2–3%** of its adult population.
- Within Europe, **Switzerland** is exceptional:
  - with fewer than **10 million inhabitants**, it hosts around **1 million millionaires**;
  - this implies that **more than 10% of residents are millionaires** on a net-worth basis.
- Other European countries (UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain) host between **1 and 3 million** millionaires each.

Implications:

- Europe has a broad but more fragmented private-capital base than the US;
- Switzerland, in particular, is a natural location for:
  - **family offices, private banks and wealth platforms**;
  - fund domicile and holding structures.

## 5. Relation to VC and consulting

The wealth structure helps explain:

- why the US maintains long-term dominance in **VC and PE** – deep pools of domestic capital and high risk tolerance;
- why Switzerland punches above its weight in **wealth management and niche private capital**;
- why Chinese VC relies more on institutional, corporate and state capital than on broad-based angel activity.

For consulting:

- a large HNWI base increases demand for **private wealth advisory** and related consulting;
- in regions with many affluent family-owned businesses (e.g. Germany, Italy, Switzerland), consulting demand is driven by:
  - succession planning,
  - governance,
  - professionalisation and international expansion.

## Caveat

- Millionaire counts depend heavily on asset-price levels and FX rates; a strong dollar can change counts materially from one year to the next.
- Methodologies differ across wealth reports; some countries may be under- or over-represented.
- Net-worth thresholds ignore **liquidity**; many millionaires have wealth tied in real estate or illiquid business assets, which matters for investible capital.
