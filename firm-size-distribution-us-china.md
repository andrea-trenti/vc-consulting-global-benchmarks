# Micro and Small Firm Structure in the United States and China:
## Implications for VC and Consulting Demand

---

## Abstract

This paper compares the **micro and small enterprise landscape** in the United States and the People’s Republic of China, using recent statistics on:

- number of business entities;
- distribution of firm size (by number of employees);
- average and median revenue for small firms.

It then explores how these structures influence:

- demand for **consulting services**; and
- the addressable market for **B2B startups** selling productivity and analytics tools.

The main contrast is between:

- a US landscape with fewer enterprises but **higher average revenue per small firm**, and
- a Chinese landscape with **very large numbers of micro entities**, many of which have extremely low turnover.

## 1. Introduction

Firm size distribution is a key determinant of B2B market structure. High numbers of very small firms imply:

- fragmented demand,
- limited ability to pay for high-ticket consulting or software,
- heavy reliance on low-cost, standardised tools.

By contrast, a smaller number of larger SMEs can support **richer service ecosystems** (consulting, vertical SaaS, financial products).

## 2. Data

### 2.1 China – business entities and small firms

Recent statistics indicate that:

- total registered **business entities** in China exceed **180–190 million**, with the **private economy** accounting for roughly **180 million** of them;
- this includes:
  - around **55–56 million companies** (incorporated entities);
  - about **125–127 million individual industrial and commercial households** (self-employed).

Surveys of micro and small enterprises show that:

- the **median firm** has **one employee**;
- **~45%** of firms have **no employees** (solo entrepreneurs);
- about **40%** have **1–4 employees**;
- in some samples, nearly **half of micro/piccole imprese** report quarterly revenue below **25,000 RMB** (≈100,000 RMB per year ≈14,000 USD);
- in more robust samples, median quarterly revenue is around **130,000 RMB** (~20,500 USD), corresponding to **~80,000 USD** per year.

These numbers suggest that:

- a substantial fraction of Chinese small businesses operate at **very low turnover**;
- only a minority can comfortably purchase non-essential consulting or subscription SaaS.

### 2.2 United States – small businesses and revenue

In the United States:

- there are roughly **33–35 million small businesses**, of which:
  - around **6–7 million** are employer firms;
  - the remainder are **non-employer** entities (solo proprietors, gig workers, freelancers);
- small businesses employ **more than 60 million workers**, close to **46% of the workforce**;
- the **average revenue** for small businesses is estimated at **around USD 1.2 million per year**;
- for **non-employer** firms, typical annual revenue is about **USD 45–50k**.

The typical small employer business thus has significantly higher turnover than the typical Chinese microenterprise, even discounting exchange-rate and price-level differences.

## 3. Comparative analysis

### 3.1 Entity counts vs economic mass

Relative to GDP:

- China has **far more registered entities per unit of GDP** than the US;
- many of these entities are **very small and informal in practice**, even if formally registered;
- the US has fewer firms but a much larger **average scale**, especially among employer firms.

### 3.2 Implications for consulting

For **management consulting**:

- in China, the core market for professional consulting is concentrated in:
  - large corporates,
  - upper-tier SMEs,
  - state-owned enterprises and government projects;
- the long tail of micro firms is largely serviced by:
  - local accountants,
  - generic business services,
  - templated online offerings.

In the US:

- a significant fraction of SMEs can afford **project-based consulting** at least occasionally;
- industry niches support **specialised boutique consultancies** (e.g., revenue-growth, digital marketing, operations), often working with firms in the USD 5–50 million revenue bracket.

### 3.3 Implications for B2B SaaS and analytics startups

For **VC-backed B2B startups**:

- the US offers:
  - a large mid-market of SMEs with high willingness to pay for productivity tools;
  - many niches where **ACV (average contract value)** can reach USD 10–100k without selling to global giants.
- China offers:
  - an enormous numerical base of tiny firms suitable for **low-ARPU, high-scale digital platforms** (payment apps, e-commerce tools, basic bookkeeping);
  - a smaller but significant segment of larger private firms and SOEs that require complex, often customised solutions (where domestic champions and large tech groups are strong competitors).

## 4. Strategic positioning for data-driven products

A quantitative strategy might be:

- **US / Western Europe / Switzerland**
  - target mid-market and upper-SME segments;
  - price around the **value of saved consultant days**;
  - rely on consulting partners to resell and integrate.

- **China**
  - either play a **very high-volume, low-price** platform game (requiring local scale and regulatory know-how), or
  - focus on **large enterprises and SOEs**, usually in partnership with local IT integrators.

## Caveat

- Chinese microenterprise statistics are based on surveys with different sampling frames; estimates for the share of very low-revenue firms are therefore approximate.
- US small-business revenue data often come from financing or tax datasets and may be biased towards surviving firms.
- Cross-country comparisons do not fully adjust for price-level and purchasing-power differences.
