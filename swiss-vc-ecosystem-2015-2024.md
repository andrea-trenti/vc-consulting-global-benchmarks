# The Swiss Venture Capital Ecosystem 2015–2024:
## Growth, Geography and Deeptech Specialisation

---

## Abstract

This paper examines the evolution of **venture capital investment in Switzerland** between 2015 and 2024. Using a ten-year time series of annual VC flows and qualitative evidence on sectoral and geographic patterns, it documents:

- a **3.5× increase** in annual VC volumes over the decade, with a compound annual growth rate around **14–15%**;
- strong concentration of deals and capital in the **Zurich–Zug–Schwyz** corridor;
- a pronounced bias towards **deeptech, life sciences and advanced ICT**, often anchored to university spin-offs;
- resilience during global downturns, with a temporary peak in 2021–2022 followed by a cyclical adjustment.

The analysis positions Switzerland as a **small but capital-dense ecosystem** whose structure is particularly favourable to high-complexity, technology-intensive startups.

## 1. Introduction

Switzerland combines high GDP per capita, a stable institutional framework and strong research universities (ETH Zurich, EPFL, and several university hospitals). Over the last decade, it has also emerged as a relevant node in European venture capital.

This paper takes a data-driven view on the period **2015–2024**, focusing on three dimensions:

1. **Aggregate growth** of VC investment;
2. **Geographic concentration** of capital within Switzerland;
3. **Sectoral structure**, with particular emphasis on deeptech and life sciences.

---

## 2. Data and methods

The analysis relies on:

- annual Swiss VC reports and public summaries, which provide **annual volumes and sector breakdowns**;
- complementary information on **regional distribution** of VC within Switzerland;
- macroeconomic data (GDP, population) from Swiss national statistics.

Amounts are expressed in **million CHF** unless otherwise noted. Where precise annual numbers are not publicly available for all sub-categories, we work with **ranges** and **shares**.

### 3.1 Annual VC volumes

Table 1 reports approximate annual VC volumes for Swiss startups.

**Table 1 – Switzerland VC investment by year (approximate)**

| Year | VC investment (mn CHF) | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| 2015 | ~670                   | Early phase of current cycle. |
| 2016 | ~900                   | First significant uptick. |
| 2017 | ~940                   | Consolidation. |
| 2018 | ~1,240                 | Breakthrough above 1 bn CHF. |
| 2019 | ~2,290                 | Strong expansion, several large rounds. |
| 2020 | ~2,120                 | Mild decline in the first COVID year. |
| 2021 | ~3,060                 | Record year, wave of late-stage deals. |
| 2022 | ~3,970                 | Peak of the cycle, almost 4 bn CHF. |
| 2023 | ~2,590                 | Normalisation after global tech correction. |
| 2024 | ~2,370                 | Further adjustment but still far above 2015–2017 levels. |

Between 2015 and 2024, cumulative VC volume amounts to **~21–22 bn CHF**, with more than half invested in the three years 2021–2023.

### 3.2 Growth rates

Taking 2015 (676 mn CHF) and 2024 (~2,370 mn CHF):

- the **growth factor** is approximately 3.5×;
- the implied **CAGR** over nine years is around **14–15%** per annum.

Even after the post-2021 correction, 2024 volumes remain **~3.5×** higher than in 2015.

## 4. Geographic concentration

### 4.1 Zurich, Zug and Schwyz

Swiss VC is heavily concentrated in the **Zurich region**, which, in extended definitions, includes the cantons of Zurich, Zug and Schwyz.

Indicative figures for cumulative VC 2014–H1 2024:

- **Zurich region (Zurich + Zug + Schwyz):** nearly **10 bn CHF**, about **50% of all Swiss VC**;
- within the region:
  - **Canton Zurich** accounts for roughly **75–80%** of regional volumes;
  - **Canton Zug** contributes around **18–20%**;
  - **Canton Schwyz** captures a small residual share.

In 2023 alone:

- total Swiss VC was about **2.6 bn CHF**;
- **Zurich** attracted **~870 mn CHF** (~one-third of the national total);
- **Zug** attracted **~450 mn CHF** (roughly one-fifth).

### 4.2 Other clusters

Beyond the Zurich–Zug–Schwyz axis, other relevant clusters include:

- **Lake Geneva region (Vaud, Geneva):** reinforced by EPFL, UNIL and UNIGE;
- **Basel region:** strong in pharma and life sciences, with linkage to large incumbents;
- **Bern and other cantons:** niche specialisations in medtech, manufacturing and cleantech.

However, no other region matches Zurich’s combination of deal count, capital volume and depth of investor base.

## 5. Sectoral structure

Swiss VC exhibits a notable **deeptech and life sciences bias**:

- historically, **ICT/software** and **biotech/medtech** together capture **more than two-thirds of invested capital**;
- within ICT, there is an increasing share of **AI, machine learning and data-driven enterprise software**;
- within life sciences, capital is concentrated in **biotech, therapeutics, medical devices and diagnostics**.

In peak years (2021–2022):

- individual biotech rounds above **100 mn CHF** were not exceptional;
- cleantech and climate-related technologies (energy storage, grid optimisation, advanced materials) started to appear more prominently in the top deals lists.

---

## 6. University spin-offs and institutional backbone

The role of universities – particularly ETH Zurich and EPFL – is central:

- ETH Zurich reports **over 600 spin-offs to date**, with around **30–40 new spin-offs per year** in recent vintages;
- survival rates after five and ten years are **above 90% and 80%**, respectively, for spin-offs that make it to the VC stage;
- ETH-linked spin-offs alone raise several **hundred million CHF** per year in equity, often with participation from international investors.

On the investor side, the Zurich region hosts:

- **>200 private capital firms** (VC, growth equity, PE, multi-family offices);
- **~3,600–4,000 employees** in these organisations;
- **thousands of foundations and holding structures**, including in neighbouring canton Zug, which benefits from attractive tax treatment.

---

## 7. Resilience and cyclicality

The 2021–2022 peak and subsequent decline illustrate both the **cyclical nature** of VC and the **resilience** of the Swiss ecosystem:

- volumes fell from nearly 4 bn CHF in 2022 to roughly 2.4 bn CHF in 2024, mirroring global corrections;
- the **number of rounds** declined less than volumes, suggesting that early-stage activity remained relatively stable while late-stage megadeals compressed;
- the presence of large corporates (pharma, financial institutions, industrial groups) provides **strategic capital and M&A exits**, which stabilise the ecosystem.

---

## 8. Strategic implications

For founders and investors:

- Switzerland offers **high per-capita VC intensity** and strong deeptech capabilities, but the **domestic market is small**; global orientation is almost mandatory.
- The Zurich–Zug axis is particularly attractive for:
  - B2B software and AI,
  - crypto-adjacent and fintech (subject to regulatory evolutions),
  - holding and treasury functions for international groups.

For policymakers:

- maintaining openness to international talent and capital is crucial;
- preserving the **university–startup–investor** pipeline (including IP and spin-off rules) has high leverage on the ecosystem.

---

## Caveat

- Annual VC figures are reconstructed from multiple public sources and should be read as **approximations**, not exact statistics.
- Sector shares are indicative; many deeptech companies sit at the intersection of several categories (e.g. AI in life sciences).
- The geographic split is sensitive to how multi-site companies are assigned to cantons.
- The paper does not cover **returns** or the performance distribution of Swiss VC funds.
