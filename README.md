# VC & Consulting – Global Benchmarks

This repository provides a set of **data-driven, academic-style notes** on the relationship between:

- **Venture Capital (VC) intensity**
- **Management consulting markets**
- **Wealth and firm structure**

across major economies: **United States, China, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland**, plus selected European aggregates.

The goal is not to replicate full datasets, but to build **clean benchmarks and ratios** (VC / GDP, VC per capita, consulting / GDP, HNWI base, firm size distribution) that are directly usable in:

- investor memos,
- strategy decks,
- startup geography decisions,
- academic or semi-academic essays.

All content is in Markdown only. No spreadsheets or notebooks are required.

## 1. Papers in this repository

The core of the repo consists of **seven standalone papers**, each in its own Markdown file:

1. `paper1-vc-intensity-global-vs-europe.md`  
   *Global VC intensity in 2024: the US, China, Japan, Europe and Switzerland compared.*

2. `paper2-swiss-vc-ecosystem-2015-2024.md`  
   *The Swiss VC ecosystem 2015–2024, with a focus on Zurich, Zug and Schwyz.*

3. `paper3-consulting-markets-benchmarks.md`  
   *Management consulting markets, GDP, headcount and firm structure in the G7 + Switzerland.*

4. `paper4-vc-consulting-complementarity.md`  
   *How VC and consulting interact: complementarities, substitutability and cross-country patterns.*

5. `paper5-firm-size-distribution-us-china.md`  
   *Micro and small firm structure in the US and China and its implications for B2B startups and consulting.*

6. `paper6-wealth-hnwi-and-private-capital.md`  
   *Millionaires, wealth concentration and the depth of the private-capital ecosystem in major economies.*

7. `paper7-sectoral-composition-europe-switzerland.md`  
   *Sectoral composition of VC in Europe and Switzerland (software, deeptech, biotech, cleantech, AI) and its links to consulting demand.*

Each paper follows a **compact academic structure** (abstract, introduction, data and methods, empirical results, discussion, caveats) and includes multiple tables with macro, VC, consulting and wealth indicators.

## 2. Scope and philosophy

Across the seven papers, the repo provides:

- **Orders of magnitude** and ranges rather than fragile point estimates.
- **Ratios and benchmarks**: VC/GDP, VC per capita, consulting / GDP, HNWI per million inhabitants, average firm size, etc.
- **Cross-country comparisons** between:
  - large, VC-intense markets (US, UK, Israel when relevant),
  - large but under-ventured economies (Italy, Spain, parts of China),
  - small but very capital-dense markets (Switzerland, Singapore when used as a control).

The aim is to offer a **clean analytic skeleton** that can be refined with more granular data if needed.

## 3. How to use this repo

- **Founders & investors**  
  Use the ratios and time series to justify geography choices in investment memos, internal notes or board decks.

- **Consultants & analysts**  
  Reuse the tables as a starting point for market-sizing and strategy work; plug in more detailed sector data as needed.

- **Students & researchers**  
  Treat the seven papers as empirical notes that can be cited or extended for theses, term papers or independent projects.
