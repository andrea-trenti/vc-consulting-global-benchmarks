# Sectoral Composition of Venture Capital in Europe and Switzerland:
## Software, Deeptech, Biotech, Cleantech and AI

---

## Abstract

This paper analyses the **sectoral composition** of VC investment in Europe and Switzerland, focusing on five broad categories:

1. Software and internet;
2. Deeptech (including advanced hardware, robotics, semiconductors);
3. Biotech and medtech;
4. Cleantech and climate tech;
5. Artificial intelligence (AI) as a cross-cutting layer.

It uses public VC reports and sector breakdowns to:

- identify which sectors dominate VC flows in Europe;
- show how **Switzerland** differs from the European average;
- discuss implications for **consulting and B2B demand**.

## 1. Data and classification

Sectoral data come from:

- Europe-wide VC reports (Dealroom, KPMG, European Investment Fund analyses);
- Swiss VC reports for the national breakdown.

While taxonomies differ (some split fintech separately, others subsume AI into software), a common structure can be imposed:

- **Software & Internet** – SaaS, platforms, consumer and enterprise software;
- **Fintech** – payments, neobanks, trading platforms (often included in software in some sources);
- **Deeptech** – robotics, semiconductors, advanced manufacturing, IoT hardware;
- **Biotech & Medtech** – therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices;
- **Cleantech & Climate** – renewables, energy storage, grid, climate analytics, circular economy;
- **AI** – startups whose core value proposition is ML/AI (can overlap with above sectors).

## 2. Europe-wide sector mix

In recent years, Europe-wide VC has been roughly distributed as follows (shares of total capital invested):

- **Software & Internet + Fintech**: **~45–55%**;
- **Biotech & Medtech**: **~15–20%**;
- **Deeptech (non-bio)**: **~10–15%**;
- **Cleantech & Climate**: **~10–15%**, with a strong upward trend;
- **Other** (consumer products, services, etc.): **~10%**.

AI acts as a transversal layer:

- a large fraction of new software and deeptech deals is now labelled **AI-enabled** or **AI-native**;
- AI-specific startups absorbed **a growing share of mega-rounds** in 2023–2024, especially in the UK, France and Germany.

## 3. Switzerland’s sector mix

Swiss VC exhibits distinctive features:

- **Biotech & Medtech** historically capture a **very high share** of capital, often **30–40%** of annual VC flows;
- **ICT / Software** represents **30–40%**, with an increasing AI component;
- **Cleantech & Industrial tech** account for a non-trivial share (around **10–15%**), consistent with Swiss strengths in engineering and precision manufacturing;
- **Fintech and crypto-adjacent** ventures have shown episodic spikes (especially around Zug’s “Crypto Valley”), but their share is volatile due to regulatory cycles.

Years like 2021–2022 saw:

- multiple biotech rounds above **100 mn CHF**;
- several large AI/fintech and crypto infrastructure rounds;
- rising interest in **climate tech**, including energy storage, building efficiency and grid optimisation.

## 4. Sectoral comparison: Switzerland vs Europe

### 4.1 Biotech and medtech

- Europe: important but not dominant (15–20% of total VC);
- Switzerland: **structurally overweight**, due to:
  - proximity to global pharma companies (Basel region),
  - strong university hospitals and research institutes,
  - favourable environment for IP-heavy ventures.

### 4.2 Software and AI

- Europe: software/fintech is the **largest single bucket**, both in deal count and capital;
- Switzerland: software is large but **not as dominant** as in the UK or France; many software startups are B2B and specialised (industry, finance, security).

AI:

- European AI investment is heavily concentrated in a few hubs (London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam).
- Zurich participates as an **AI research hub** and benefits from ETH Zurich’s reputation; a significant share of Swiss AI VC is captured by Zurich-based companies.

### 4.3 Cleantech and industrial tech

- Europe: cleantech’s share has been increasing, especially in countries with strong policy support (Germany, Nordics, Netherlands, France).
- Switzerland: cleantech plays a growing but still secondary role; however, the intersection with **industrial tech, precision engineering and grid technology** is promising given the country’s engineering tradition.

## 5. Link to consulting demand

Different sector mixes generate different types of consulting and B2B demand:

- **Biotech & Medtech**
  - high demand for **regulatory, clinical and market-access consulting**;
  - strong interface with large pharma and medical-device companies;
  - suitable ground for specialised data/analytics startups serving both startups and incumbents.

- **Software & AI**
  - heavy demand for **implementation consulting, systems integration and change management**;
  - supports ecosystems of strategy boutiques and IT integrators.

- **Cleantech & Industrial tech**
  - drives **infrastructure and project-finance consulting**;
  - requires multi-disciplinary teams (engineering, regulation, finance).

For Switzerland:

- the biotech/deeptech bias aligns well with its strong **life-sciences and industrial consulting** sectors;
- AI-intensive startups can leverage both **academic credibility (ETH/EPFL)** and **consulting channels** into financial and industrial clients.

## Caveat

- Sector classifications vary significantly across VC databases; the groupings used here are harmonised ex-post and inevitably blurring some boundaries.
- Shares are based on capital invested, not number of deals; seed-heavy sectors may be under-represented.
- Data for 2024 are preliminary and subject to revision as late-reported rounds are included.
