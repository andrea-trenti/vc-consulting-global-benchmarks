# Global Venture Capital Intensity in 2024:
## United States, China, Japan, Europe and Switzerland in Comparative Perspective

---

## Abstract

This note benchmarks **venture capital (VC) intensity** across major economies in 2024, focusing on the United States, China, Japan, the large European economies (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain) and Switzerland.  
Using recent VC flow estimates combined with macroeconomic aggregates, it constructs a set of comparable ratios:

- VC investment as a percentage of GDP
- VC investment per capita
- Each country’s share of **global** and **European** VC

The analysis shows that:

- the **United States** remains structurally dominant in absolute VC flows and stands in the global top tier in VC/GDP;
- **China** remains large in absolute terms but is an order of magnitude less VC-intense when scaled by GDP and population;
- within **Europe**, the **UK–France–Germany** triangle concentrates most of the capital, while **Switzerland** stands out in per-capita terms;
- Southern European economies (Italy, Spain) still exhibit thin VC layers relative to their macro size, despite gradual improvement.

## 1. Introduction

Venture capital has become a central mechanism for financing high-growth, innovation-driven firms. Country-level comparisons, however, must go beyond absolute volumes and focus on **intensity measures** that scale VC by GDP and population.

This paper contributes a compact, data-driven comparison for 2024. It answers three questions:

1. How large is total VC investment across the major economies?
2. How does VC scale relative to GDP and population?
3. Where do European countries – including Switzerland – sit in the global distribution?

---

## 2. Data and methods

### 2.1 VC flows

The analysis uses:

- global VC aggregates for 2024 from major industry reports (Dealroom and KPMG Venture Pulse), which place **global VC flows in the USD 330–370 billion range**;
- country-level VC volumes for 2024 from Dealroom, regional VC reports and national venture capital associations, converted into USD where necessary;
- European aggregates that indicate total **European VC around EUR 56–60 billion** in 2024 and confirm the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland as top destinations by volume and/or per capita.

Given methodological differences across providers (stage coverage, inclusion of corporate venture, FX assumptions), the paper uses **order-of-magnitude figures** and **narrow ranges** rather than single point estimates.

### 2.2 Macroeconomic data

Macroeconomic indicators are taken from:

- IMF and World Bank (GDP in current USD);
- national statistical offices (population).

For each country, we compute:

- **GDP per capita** (USD);
- **VC/GDP** (VC flows divided by GDP);
- **VC per capita** (VC flows divided by population);
- **country share of global VC** and, for European countries, **share of European VC**.

## 3. Global VC totals and shares

### 3.1 Global VC in 2024

Global VC investment in 2024 can be bounded as follows:

- Dealroom: about **USD 330 billion**, up ~6% year on year, with ~25,000 funding rounds.
- KPMG Venture Pulse: about **USD 368 billion**, highlighting renewed interest in AI and a recovery in megarounds.

For the purposes of ratios, this paper takes **USD 350 billion** as a working mid-point.

### 3.2 Country-level VC flows and global shares

Table 1 summarises 2024 VC flows for the focus countries and their approximate share of global VC.

**Table 1 – VC flows and global shares, 2024 (orders of magnitude)**

| Country        | VC 2024 (USD bn, mid-point) | Share of global VC | Comments |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| United States  | ~210                        | ~60%               | Dominant global hub, deep late-stage market. |
| China          | ~23 (13–33 range)          | ~7%                | Significantly below 2021 peak after regulatory tightening. |
| Japan          | ~20                         | ~6%                | Stable, moderate growth, strong corporate VC involvement. |
| Germany        | ~8                          | ~2–3%              | Largest continental EU destination alongside France. |
| United Kingdom | ~15.5                       | ~4–5%              | Europe’s leading VC hub, anchored in London. |
| France         | ~8.5                        | ~2–3%              | Strong late-stage rounds in fintech and deeptech. |
| Italy          | ~1.25                       | <0.5%              | Catch-up dynamics from a low base. |
| Spain          | ~2.1                        | ~0.6%              | Concentrated around a small number of growth rounds. |
| Switzerland    | ~2.6                        | ~0.7–0.8%          | Very high per-capita levels, strong deeptech and life sciences. |

At a European level, the UK, France and Germany together account for **around 50–60% of all European VC**, with Switzerland adding a small but visible share.

## 4. VC intensity: scaling by GDP

### 4.1 GDP and VC/GDP ratios

Table 2 reports GDP, VC and the corresponding VC/GDP ratio.

**Table 2 – VC as a percentage of GDP, 2024**

| Country        | GDP 2024 (USD tn) | VC 2024 (USD bn) | VC/GDP (%) |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------:|
| United States  | ~29.2             | 210              | ~0.7       |
| China          | ~18.7             | 23               | ~0.07–0.18 |
| Japan          | ~4.0              | 20               | ~0.5       |
| Germany        | ~4.7              | 8                | ~0.17      |
| United Kingdom | ~3.6–3.7          | 15.5             | ~0.3–0.4   |
| France         | ~3.2              | 8.5              | ~0.27      |
| Italy          | ~2.37             | 1.25             | ~0.05      |
| Spain          | ~1.7              | 2.1              | ~0.12      |
| Switzerland    | ~0.94–0.95        | 2.6              | ~0.27      |

Two patterns emerge:

1. **US exceptionalism** – the United States combines extremely high GDP with very high VC/GDP (≈0.7%), resulting in an ecosystem that is both deep and broad.
2. **European heterogeneity** – VC/GDP ranges from ~0.3–0.4% in the UK to ~0.05% in Italy, with Switzerland standing close to France in VC/GDP despite its much smaller scale.

China appears structurally under-ventured when scaled by GDP, with VC/GDP roughly one-tenth of the US level.

### 4.2 VC per capita

A complementary view scales VC by population.

**Table 3 – VC per capita, 2024**

| Country        | Population (m) | VC per capita (USD) |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| United States  | ~342           | ~600                |
| China          | ~1,420         | ~10–25             |
| Japan          | ~124           | ~160                |
| Germany        | ~83–84         | ~100                |
| United Kingdom | ~69            | ~200–230           |
| France         | ~67–68         | ~120–130           |
| Italy          | ~59            | ~20                 |
| Spain          | ~48            | ~40–45             |
| Switzerland    | ~9             | ~270–280           |

Per capita, **Switzerland** and the **United States** appear as two different but comparably intense models:

- the US: large domestic demand, network effects, deep late-stage capital;
- Switzerland: small but extremely capital-dense environment, with strong university-linked deeptech.

Southern Europe sits at the bottom of the distribution, which has implications for startup valuation levels, density of local investors and bargaining power of founders.

## 5. Europe in the global context

Within Europe:

- total VC is around **EUR 56–60 billion**, corresponding to roughly **15–20% of global VC**;
- the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland together explain **more than two-thirds of European VC**;
- a handful of cities (London, Paris, Berlin, Zurich, Stockholm, Amsterdam) act as dominant hubs.

Compared with the US, Europe remains smaller in absolute terms and more fragmented. However, several European countries reach **VC/GDP ratios that are only 2–3× lower than the US**, which is much less dramatic than absolute volumes would suggest.

---

## 6. Discussion

Three high-level insights follow from the data:

1. **Scale vs intensity**  
   China and, in a different way, Japan show that large GDP does not automatically imply high VC intensity. Policy, capital-market structure and innovation culture matter.

2. **Small, capital-dense ecosystems**  
   Switzerland’s figures illustrate how a small country can host a VC ecosystem comparable, in per-capita terms, to much larger economies. This is relevant for founders choosing headquarters locations versus end-markets.

3. **European opportunity**  
   The gap between the US and the UK/France/Germany is sizeable but not prohibitive. For seed and early-growth stages, Europe’s ratios already support credible startup ecosystems, especially when combined with EU-level programs and cross-border investors.

---

## 7. Conclusion

By normalising VC flows by GDP and population, this paper offers a compact view of where major economies stand in 2024. The US remains structurally dominant, China is under-ventured relative to its economic size, and Europe presents a mixed picture with a small core of high-intensity markets and a periphery still in early development. Switzerland, despite its size, is firmly positioned among the global leaders in VC intensity.

## Caveat

- VC statistics differ across providers (e.g., Dealroom vs KPMG) in stage coverage and treatment of corporate and growth equity rounds; all numbers should be read as **orders of magnitude**.
- GDP and population data are updated at different frequencies; for some countries 2024 values are interpolated from 2023 estimates.
- VC per capita and VC/GDP ignore sectoral composition and the share of foreign vs domestic investors.
- The analysis does not address **returns**, only **capital deployed**.
